Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
None proved incorrect as such and my results were pretty even between belgium and brazil no matter the amount of sims.
10: belgium
100: brazil
1000: belgium
10000: brazil
100000: tie belgium brazil 0.01% difference
1000000: belgium
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I would go for 1000, since there is no difference in time of execution between 10 and 100, but there is no difference in price between 100 and 1000 since you are charged by the second.
